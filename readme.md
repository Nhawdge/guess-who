# Guess who
This was inspired by the many faces of a co-worker

1. If you'd like you contribute a game, upload your images into the your own folder in the games folder.
1. Add your images with a title to the guesswhoconfig.js in the following format ```        {
            name: 'Lorem Pizza',
            images: [
                { src: "/games/your-game/your-file-name.png", title: "your image name" },
                { src: "/games/your-game/your-file-name.png", title: "your image name" }                
            ],
        },```
